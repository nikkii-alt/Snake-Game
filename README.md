# Snake-Game
This is a classic snake game which I have created using Java.The game can be played using the keyboard arrows to move the snake around the screen and eat food pellets. The goal of the game is to grow the snake as long as possible without hitting the walls or itself.It is mainly written using JavaFX,Java Swing.
